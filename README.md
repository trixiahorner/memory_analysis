# Memory Analysis with Volatility
In this lab, we will perform memory analysis on a compromised system using Volatility. When a cloud-based or virtual machine server shows signs of compromise, taking a snapshot of the virtual machine is a stealthy way to capture its memory without alerting the attacker. This snapshot allows for thorough analysis without detection.

We will start by decompressing the memory dump of the compromised system. Using Volatility, we will then analyze network connections and process information to identify malware. While Volatility is a powerful free tool, it has some limitations, particularly with network PIDs. However, the concepts demonstrated here are applicable to any commercial tools you might use in your environment.
